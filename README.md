NYT-React

NYT React is an application that allows users to input, search, and return specific content portions from The New York Times. There will be three main portions loaded onto the index page: a search engine, list of search results, and a list of saved articles.

Within the search engine, users will:

1) Enter input and submit specific search criteria that will cover topics, start year, and end year:

![Alt text](/public/assets/images/enter image name here?raw=true "This is our search box section.")

Within the results section, users will:

1) Receive a list of returned articles and links from their search input that will allow them the option to save each article individually.

![Alt text](/public/assets/images/enter image name here?raw=true "This is our result section.")

Within the saved articles section, users will:

1) Be introduced a list of articles they have saved from the results section list that they will have the opportunity to view, revisit and/or remove.
